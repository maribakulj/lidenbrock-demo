"""Centralised matrix of text-migration guards across the pipeline.

The LLM occasionally tries to move text between OCR lines — completing a
hyphenated word into PART1, absorbing a neighbour into a line, dropping
PART2 because it "looks redundant". Three stages of the pipeline guard
against this, each with its own thresholds and its own remedy:

  +----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | Stage    | Module             | Scope              | Action on hit     |
  +----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | A.       | jobs/validator.py  | Hyphen pair        | Raise             |
  | Validate | _check_pair_drift  | (PART1+PART2)      | HyphenIntegrity-  |
  | (pre-   |                    | word counts        | Error → retry at  |
  | retry)   |                    |                    | temp 0.0          |
  +----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | B.       | jobs/              | Hyphen pair        | Fall back to OCR  |
  | Recon-   | migration_guards   | (PART1+PART2)      | for both sides;   |
  | cile     | part1_text_*       | word counts +      | neutralise        |
  |          | part2_text_*       | char-length        | SUBS_CONTENT      |
  |          | part2_boundary_*   | + boundary word    |                   |
  +----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | C.       | jobs/              | Single line vs.    | Fall back to OCR  |
  | Accept   | line_acceptance.py | source +           | for that line;    |
  | (post-  | check_line         | neighbours         | capture rejection |
  | recon-   | check_adjacent_*   | (SequenceMatcher)  | reason            |
  | cile)    |                    |                    |                   |
  +----------+--------------------+--------------------+-------------------+

The thresholds intentionally differ:

  - Stage A is the *strictest* — a hyphen drift is suspicious enough to
    retry the whole chunk before any fallback is applied.
  - Stage B catches drift the LLM produced *intentionally* despite the
    retry. The fallback preserves the OCR pair atomically.
  - Stage C is a *line-level* safety net that fires regardless of
    hyphen role: it catches absorption / neighbour migration that the
    pair-level guards can't see.

This module owns the pair-level helpers (stage B). Stage A and stage C
live close to their callers (validator and line_acceptance) because the
remedy is tightly coupled to the local control flow. Centralising the
behaviours here would require moving HyphenIntegrityError out of
validator.py and creating a circular import — not worth the cost.

When tuning thresholds, look at all three stages: tightening one stage
without adjusting the others can leak migrations through the gap.
