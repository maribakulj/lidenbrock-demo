"""Shared Unicode normalization helpers for ALTO text handling.

NFC normalization is essential when comparing strings sourced from
heterogeneous ALTO producers and from LLM outputs: a French word
like 'café' may arrive in precomposed (NFC) or decomposed (NFD) form,
and a naive ``==`` or ``.lower()`` comparison silently fails to
match the two.
