"""Shared text reconstruction for ALTO TextLine elements.

Both the parser (which builds `LineManifest.ocr_text`) and the rewriter
(which compares the source XML against corrected text on the UNTOUCHED
path) need to walk a TextLine's String/SP/HYP children and produce the
same logical string. Centralising the logic prevents the two from
drifting apart — the very bug `rewriter.py` documents in its
``_line_text_unchanged`` history.

The function returned here is the raw, NFC-normalised reconstruction.
Callers that want the "logical" form (parser-side) wrap with
``.replace("\\r", "").strip()`` on top.

    Rules:
      - String contributes its CONTENT attribute verbatim.
      - SP contributes a single space.
      - HYP contributes its CONTENT (defaulting to "-"), with U+00AD
        (soft hyphen) collapsed to "-". If the accumulated text
        already ends with "-", the HYP is skipped so a String
        ending in "-" followed by a HYP doesn't produce "--".
