"""Tests for backend observers (CompositeObserver + LoggingObserver).

Roadmap L4 — backend/app/jobs/observers.py had zero direct test
coverage. These tests pin the two non-obvious contracts of the
adapter layer:

  - CompositeObserver isolates failures: one broken observer must not
    deny event delivery to siblings.
  - LoggingObserver's level mapping (warning vs debug) — covered in
    L8 (T1a), not here.

    Pre-L8 this mapping was entirely untested: a refactor that moved
    a critical event out of `_WARNING_EVENTS` (silently dropping it to
    DEBUG) would not have failed any test.

    keyed on event-type substrings rather than a strict count, so an
    unrelated module emitting its own WARNING during the test cannot
    flip the result. The contract we pin is: for each of these three
